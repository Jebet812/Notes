**Cloud Computing:** On demand delivery of IT resources over the internet.

***Advantages of Cloud Computing***

* **Go global in minutes:** You can deploy applications around the world in minutes while providing customers with low latency.
* **Trade upfront expense for variable expense:** You only pay for computing resources consumed instead of investing heavily on data centres or servers not knowing you will use them or not.
* **Stop guessing capacity:** Capacity is matched to demand.
* **Benefit from massive economies of scale:** Volume discounts are passed which translates  to lower pay-as-you-go prices.
* **Increased speed and agility:** You can innovate quickly and deliver applications faster.
* **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers:**

***Benefits of Cloud Computing***

* **High Availability:** High Available systems are desiggned to operate continously without failure for a long time by reducing and managing failure.
* **Elasticity:** You can provision only what need then grow or shrink on demand.
* **Agility:** All services give you access to help you innovate faster, giving you speed to market.
* **Durability:** Data remains intact without corruption.

***Cloud Computing Models***

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Contains asic building locks for cloud IT that can be rented *e.g.* Amazon EC2.
* **Platfrorm as a Service(PaaS):** Enables you develop software using web-based tools without worrying about underlying infrastructure *e.g.* AWS Cloud9.
* **Software as a Service(SaaS):** Provides you with completed product managed and run by a service provider *e.g.* Amazon SageMaker.

***Cloud Computing Deployment Models***

* **Cloud-based deployment:** Migrate all existing applications to cloud or design and build new applications on cloud.
* **On-Prem/Private cloud deployment:** Resources are deployed on prenises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
* **Hybrid deployment:** Connects cloud based resources to on-prem infrastructure. Supported by AWS Direct Connect.

## Global Networking

* **Regions:** They are isolated geographical areas containing AWS resources. Its characteristics are: </br>
      - They are fully independent and isolated.</br>
      - They are resource and service specific.</br>
When choosing a region for services, data and application consider these factors:</br>
      - Compliance.</br>
      - Proximity of customers.</br>
      - Available services/features within a region.</br>
      - Pricing.</br>

* **Availability Zones:** A single or a group of data centres within a region. It contains servers which you can rent and is where you provision resources and deploy applications. Its characteristics are:
     - They are physically separated.
     - They are connected through low latency links.
     - They are fault tolerant.
     - They allow for high availability.

* **Edge Locations:** Locations used to store cached copies of content close to customers for faster delivery. This is made possible through *Amazon CloudFront* (is a content delivery network to deliver data, video, applications and APIs with low latency and high transfer speeds </br>
It *reduces latency* (time between user request and resulting response) and *speeds up delivery of application.*</br>
There are more edge locations than regions and availability zones.
